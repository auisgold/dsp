description: In this project we look at implementing the JPEG compression algorithm used in many images we see online. We see how different compression ratios affect an image and the noise around salient features of an image. Many images use JPEG as you can reduce the file size of an image greatly while still keeping many of the salient features intact. To see more details of the project click <a href="http://boulderpogoraids.tk/Tao_Jesse_Lab5">here</a>. For testing you can use default images included in MATLAB to test the implementation of the algorithm.
