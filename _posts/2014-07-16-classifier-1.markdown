description: In this project we use 150 songs with 6 different genres to compare and try to classify certain tracks as certain genres. This process is similar to what apps like Spotify do to classify a large library of songs into certain genres. For this we use features such as MFCC, filter banks, rhythm, and tonality to create a classifier. You can see more details of this project <a href="http://boulderpogoraids.tk/Tao_Jesse_Lab3">here</a>. Feel free to use any audio files to test this out.
